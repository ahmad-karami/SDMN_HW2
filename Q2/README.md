# 1. Running code
my code is in golang and to run the file we use this command:
'''
go run Container.go <container_name> <memory_limit_in_MB>
'''
# Explain
this CLI command make a container with the <container_name> and set memory restraint to <memory_limit_in_MB> and I add some commands such as <bash,ls,ip,ps,hostname,sleep> to work more with our container and from ubuntu 20.04 docker image I see the file system and make my contianer filesystem it as like as ubuntu 20.04.
